Hi! I am Carli Carpenter, and this site is for my class, ICT302, at the University of Kentucky. **I am graduating this semester!** While I have been at UK, I have grown, changed, and encountered so many great experiences.
+ I have completely changed the direction of my career path
+ I joined a soroity (see the photo below) and gained tons of really great friends
+ I got to go to football games and basketball games with the student section experience- GO CATS
+ I have gained a really great education with an emphasis on preparing me for professional environments

I am going to be sad to leave UK, but am excited to finish my time here, as a student, in the most positive way possible!
