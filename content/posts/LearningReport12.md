**This week I was able to:**

*Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.*
+ I learned about extensibility in CMS modeling. This can be done via API and plug-ins.
+ *Application Programming Interface (API):* apps that are coded to work with and apply commands directly to a CMS.
+ *Plug-in:* installed software component that adds features to a CMS, therefore extending it.

*Describe and compare content management systems.*
+  In the learn activity discussion board, I found a useful extension on Hugo that would allow for more automation when presenting blog posts. This extension, also, allows for HTML to be used on Github, rather than being restricted to only Markdown.
+ In the explore activity, I found two plug-ins for WordPress. These plug-ins provided booking and managing appointments and adding popups to promote a brand and/or product. The plug-ins were described, evaluated for usefulness, and evaluated for reputablity.

*Manage content using established workflows.*
+  Last week, my group ran into some issues that were caused by a lack of communication and organization. This week, during class time, we recollected as a group and redefined resposiblities.
+ My group is preparing for the end-of-semester projects by getting started on them as soon as possible. We have made the due dates, within our group, for those projects earlier than the official due date. The goals of these early due dates are to reduce stress and maximize peer reviewing within our group.
+ As a result of the class discussion, this week's workflow for the blog post went much more smoothly.

*Identify and employ technologies related to content management.*
+ I identified several new features on Hugo and WordPress this week, in regard to extending those CMSs.
+ I employed the same technologies I do weekly, by using the CMSs, WordPress, Hugo, Canvas, and MS Teams.

*Find and use resources for self-directed learning.*
+ For my blog posts, I like to define the terms in my own words for the key concepts section. While trying to do this, I realized that after the lecture I still did not have a clear understanding of what API and plug-in meant. I googled the terms and gained a clearer understanding after browsing a collection of definitions.
