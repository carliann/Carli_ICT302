**This week I was able to:**

*Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.*
+ I revisisted the term peer review and completed peer review for my own group's project as well as another group's project.

*Manage content using established workflows.*
+ Using Kanban in Teams was vital this week for my group to complete the weekly blog post since we did not meet in class. 
+ We are, also, using the workflow we outlined to complete the end-of-semester projects.

*Identify and employ technologies related to content management.*
+ I primarily used Canvas this week to complete my assignments, but, just like every other week, I used WordPress for the projects and blog post and Github and Hugo to produce this learning report.

*Find and use resources for self-directed learning.*
+ Through the format of the learn activiity this week, I was able to get answers to questions I did not even know I had about the final projects via the discussion board. The learn activity had students post questions about the final projects and Dr. Greenhalgh would reply an answer. With the Q&A on the discussion board, it was encouraged that students read through all of the responses posted.

**This week I did not address:**
*Describing and comparing content management systems.*
