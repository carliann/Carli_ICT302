**This week I was able to:**
+ Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
+ Describing and comparing content management systems. During this week's explore activity, I pretended to be a blogger that would choose between Hugo and WordPress. I, ultimately, decided by looking at the differences between the features of both sites and how they would align with my needs for my blog.
+ Manage content using established workflows.
+ Identify and employ technologies related to content management.
+ Find and use resources for self-directed learning.
