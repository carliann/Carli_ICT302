**This week I was able to:**


*Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.*

*Describing and comparing content management systems.*
+ I explored Cloud and Canvas CMSs and reported what their purposes were, who would be likely to use them, what their important features were, and whether I would be willing to use them over WordPress. 
+ I determined that WordPress is best for me when the purpose is personal usage. However, I, already, know I like Canvas and would like to use it in a business setting. Additionally, I would be willing to use Cloud in a business setting as well.

*Manage content using established workflows.*
+ My group used MS Teams, this week, to keep up with the tasks of the weekly blog post. 
+ We used the Kanban to organize, divide, and assign tasks for the midterm projects due next week. 
+ Further, we contributed to the shared file on Teams to seal the terms we want to define and provide walk-throughs and resources for.

*Identify and employ technologies related to content management.*
+ Like prior weeks, I used Github, Hugo, WordPress, Canvas, and MS Teams. 
+ I had to use Netlify this week because my blog had errors deploying the changes I made on Github.

*Find and use resources for self-directed learning.*
+ I panicked for a split second when my blog did not publish the changes I made on Github. I was thinking I would need Dr. Greenhalgh's assistance to fix the problem, but I looked into where the error was in the code and was able to fix the problem myself.
