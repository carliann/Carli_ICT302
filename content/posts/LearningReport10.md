**This week I was able to:**

*Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.*
+ I peer reviewed my other classmate's midterm assignments, the walkthrough, resource guide, and annotated definition. Peer reviewing is an important process in content creation because of the editorial process it goes through.
+ I learned about content modeling and its components: types (the purpose of the content model), relationships (the connection between two content objects that, also, has a technical connection), attributes (small pieces of information that make up the content type), and datatypes (the type of information that is within the attribute)

*Describe and compare content management systems.*
+  I compared the content attributes, their purposes, and their data types between creating a post between Hugo and WordPress.

*Manage content using established workflows.*
+  Like other weeks, my group used MS Teams to communicate and use Kanban to organize the work that needs to be done to get blog posts done. I, also, created buckets for the remainder of the semester's blog posts that included due dates and role rotations.

*Identify and employ technologies related to content management.*
+ I used WordPress to view the midterm assignments I was peer reviewing and to add HTML code to my group's blog post, as the developer.

*Find and use resources for self-directed learning.*
+ I had to apply the material I learned about content modeling and what I know about mailing addresses and datatypes from using MS Access previously to complete the learn activity this week.
