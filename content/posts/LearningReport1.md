I have not done any related work to identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
I have not done any related work to describe and compare content management systems.
I have not done any related work to manage content using established workflows.
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. This week I worked on setting up MS Teams, Github, Netlify, and Hugo. Setting these accounts and manipulating them to do what I want them to is employing technologies related to content management.
I have not done any related work to find and use resources for self-directed learning.
