**This week I was able to:**
+ Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. I learned that content defined as material that is used for human consumption and must be edited a few times.
+ Identify and employ technologies related to content management. I continued using GitHub and Hugo to make this learning report post and an introduction page about myself that included adding a picture, markdown elements to organize text, and a link to the main page, so users can easily access the introduction page.
+ Find and use resources for self-directed learning. I learned some markdown and html language on my own, using the resourses Dr. Greenhalgh provided.

**This week I did not address:**
+ Describing and comparing content management systems.
+ Managing content using established workflows.
