**This week I was able to:**

*Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.*
+ Dr. Greenhalgh lectured about peer review. Peer review is an important step in submitting assignments and also creating content, since content must go through a editorial process. The steps to peer review are as follows: establish the standard *(understand the rubric provided)*, describe the situation *(compare the work done to the rubric criteria)*, and provide the next steps *(give recommendations to get the work to match rubric standards)*

*Describe and compare content management systems.*
+  I worked on the Walkthrough project for the group assignments. The Walkthrough was about changing the theme in Hugo. In this assignment I described the capabilities of Hugo.

*Manage content using established workflows.*
+ To get all of the work done in my group, we used MS Teams to organize work on the Kanban feature. We also used Teams as a communication tool when coordinating work between partners.

*Identify and employ technologies related to content management.*
+ We posted our blog to a WordPress post and our projects to WordPress pages. We used Google Docs to collaborate on the content written for each project, since each project was divided into teams of two people.

*Find and use resources for self-directed learning.*
+ A big part of the Walkthrough was including pictures on the WordPress page. I had only put pictures on Hugo before. I looked up the HTML tag for embedding pictures. I, then, had to do some trial and error with adding the picture to the WordPress library and putting the correct URL for the picture to actually be displayed.
