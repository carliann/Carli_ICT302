**This week I was able to:**


**This week I did not address:**

+ Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. I learned what the roles within a content management team and what a Kanban is pertaining to workflows. 
> A content management team will typically have an editor, developer, administrator, site planner, and stakeholder. An editor will create the material. A developer will stylize the material given using programming languages, such as HTML and Markdown. An administrator will oversee the duties of the editor and developer, as well as make sure all the requirements are met. A site planner will organize the project into specific tasks to ensure the project is completed by the deadline. A stakeholder will make sure the outcome has produced a display of the overall goal for the project.
>A kanban is a type of workflow strategy that shows the progress of a project with multiple columns. Traditionally, these columns are defined by a progress status and a task may only move to another column once it has reached the subsequent progress status.

+ Identify and employ technologies related to content management.
+ Find and use resources for self-directed learning.
+ Describing and comparing content management systems.
+ Managing content using established workflows.
