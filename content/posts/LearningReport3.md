**This week I was able to:**
+ Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. I learned what the roles within a content management team and what a Kanban is pertaining to workflows. 

A content management team will typically have an editor, developer, administrator, site planner, and stakeholder. An *editor* will create the material. A *developer* will stylize the material given using programming languages, such as HTML and Markdown. An *administrator* will oversee the duties of the editor and developer, as well as make sure all the requirements are met. A *site planner* will organize the project into specific tasks to ensure the project is completed by the deadline. A *stakeholder* will make sure the outcome has produced a display of the overall goal for the project.

A *Kanban* is a type of workflow strategy that shows the progress of a project with multiple columns. Traditionally, these columns are defined by a progress status and a task may only move to another column once it has reached the subsequent progress status.

+ Identify and employ technologies related to content management. Working in MS Teams, I created a Kanban to prepare for group work later in the semester.
+ Find and use resources for self-directed learning. Dr. Greenhalgh set up an assignment to explore the Kanban app in MS Teams, so I was able to figure out how to: create buckets, tasks, set priorites and due dates, change colors of tasks, assign people to tasks, set progress statuses of tasks, and make checklists within tasks.
**This week I did not address:**

+ Describing and comparing content management systems.
+ Managing content using established workflows.
