**This week I was able to:**

*Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.*
+ Channels: are a mean to distribute content
+ Content can be distributed across many channels. However, sometimes presentation may have to be changed to adhere to specific platforms.

*Describe and compare content management systems.*
+ I found specific WordPress plugins that would enable a small company to distribute content from WordPress to other channels, such as their Intranet, Internal Email, and Internal Calendar.

*Manage content using established workflows.*
+ My group had to work extra hard this week with the workflow we had established because two group members, including myself, were unable to come to class. Many reminders had to be sent out on Teams to be able to get the blog post done. 
+ Next week we will improve our workflow by meeting via video conference on Teams. This will, also, check to make sure that everyone is on track for the end-of-semester projects to allow enough time to have a group revision of each page.

*Identify and employ technologies related to content management.*
+ I learned about RSS as a way to distribute content across channels.

*Find and use resources for self-directed learning.*
+ I worked on the second walkthrough this week and applied a theme to WordPress and recorded the steps to doing this. I had never changed the theme in WordPress before, so I used my knowledge from changing the theme of Hugo to do this.
+I, also, had to do a lot of research for the explore activity to find the WordPress plugins.
