**This week I was able to:**
+ Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. WordPress is an *open-source* site. This means that the code is free to download and use by anyone.
+ Identify and employ technologies related to content management. I learned a lot about WordPress this week, including resources to use when I need help solving an issue. I learned how to access the admin side of WordPress and how to identify if a site is using WordPress. I was the editor this week for the group blog post, so I did not actually post anything to WordPress, officially. However, I made test posts and it seems relatively easy to use.
+ Find and use resources for self-directed learning. I played around with WordPress and figured out how to make a post. I, also, discovered quick post which allows you to quickly jot down ideas without worrying about HTML and saves it as a draft with basic HTML formatting.
+ Describing and comparing content management systems. During the Explore activity this week, I did a comparison between Hugo and WordPress. It seems that WordPress will allow for a more dynamic and professional setup for blog posts because it supports HTML. 
+ Manage content using established workflows. My group completed our first blog post. We accessed our workflow in Teams to keep us organized and on track for submission by the due date.
