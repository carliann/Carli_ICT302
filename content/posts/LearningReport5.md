**This week I was able to:**
+ Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. This week, I learned the difference between content and presentation. Presentation is just the way that content is displayed. When the presentation is changed, the content should stay the same. This was shown through the learn activity with CSS Zen Garden.
+ Identify and employ technologies related to content management. I changed the theme of my Hugo site using a predesigned template. 
+ Find and use resources for self-directed learning. I tried to make the template applicable to my blog by reading the README file from the template. While I was not successful in conducting these changes, I did learn more about making changes in formatting on Hugo and about hex color codes.

**This week I did not address:**
+ Describing and comparing content management systems.
+ Manage content using established workflows.
