**This week I was able to:**
+ Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. This week I learned the difference between content and presentation. Presentation is just the way that content is displayed. When the presentation is changed, the content should stay the same. 
+ Identify and employ technologies related to content management.
+ Find and use resources for self-directed learning.

**This week I did not address:**
+ Describing and comparing content management systems.
+ Manage content using established workflows.
