**This week I was able to:**
+ Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. I learned what a content management system is. A *content managament system* is a software that helps editors accomplish their goals of publishing their organized content with proper security more swiftly using automated tasks.
+ Identify and employ technologies related to content management. Again, by making this blog post, I am employing a content management system, Hugo.
+ Find and use resources for self-directed learning. I explored, on my own, the features of Hugo and how they apply to content management systems.

**This week I did not address:**
+ Describing and comparing content management systems.
+ Manage content using established workflows.
