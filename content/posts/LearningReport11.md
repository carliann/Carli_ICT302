**This week I was able to:**

*Identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.*

I learned a lot about the different content aggregation shapes.
+ *Serial content aggregation:* organized in a list in a specific order
+ *Hierarchical content aggregation:* organized with parents; the children that fall under a parent must all be formatted the same way
+ *Network content aggregation:* scatterd links
+ *Relational content aggregation:* like hierarchical content aggregation, but the children that fall under a parent all have different formatting

*Describe and compare content management systems.*
+ I compared Hugo and WordPress's content shapes in the perspective of the editor and the consumer. Then, I compared the features that are offered by each blog site to change the shape.

*Manage content using established workflows.*
+ My group used MS Teams Kanban this week to stay organized with the group blog posts.

*Identify and employ technologies related to content management.*
+  I used WordPress to publish my group's blog post this week and completed the extra assignment (menus). The menus helped to demonstrate changing the content aggregation shape.
+ I used Github, Hugo, and Netlify to create this blog post.
+ I used MS Teams to communuicate with my group and organize the content we produced this week.

*Find and use resources for self-directed learning.*
+ My group's extra assignment this week was to add menus to WordPress. I did this by playing around and doing exploration on my own to create the menu. I added a menu using categories and then added sub-items under the categories.
